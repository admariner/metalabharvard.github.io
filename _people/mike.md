Michael Maizels is a poly-disciplinary researcher working at the intersection of creativity, technology and commerce.

Current projects include a white paper examining the applicability of novel organizational paradigms to the future of creative agency work, and a piece of adaptive AdTech which synchronizes music to film content in real time.  He is also completing two books: a collection of essays on Chinese art and technology, and a new economic history of postwar American art.

Highlights from past projects include curating the worldâ€™s first museum show given to a videogame designer and discovering the ruins of covert CIA training camps in the Arkansas National Forest. He has also published three books and more than a dozen articles on topics ranging from Kanye West to the philosophy of mathematics. His most recent book, on the intersecting histories of visual art and contemporary classical music, was published by the University of Michigan in June.

He holds a PhD in the History of Art from the University of Virginia and an MBA from MIT Sloan.
