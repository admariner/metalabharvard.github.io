Lins Derry is a design researcher, creative technologist, and artist. In 2020, she graduated with distinction from the MDes, Technology program at the [Harvard Graduate School of Design](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/). Her work explores how *choreographic interfaces* can increase the somatic and spatial interactivity between humans and machines. Her hypothesis is that by integrating *choreographic thinking* into the design process of human-machine interfaces, the resulting interactions made available to users will facilitate the modulation and communication of multimodal information that is, at least in part, constituted through movement. 

Prior to graduate study, Lins performed professionally with dance companies based in New York, San Francisco, and Montréal, including [José Navas/Compagnie Flak](http://flak.org/jose-navas/en/). With these companies, she had the opportunity to tour across North America, Europe, and Asia. Highlights included dancing at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain and the Oslo Opera House in Norway. As a solo artist, she had the privilege of performing at the Beijing Dance Festival in China and at Korea’s Modern Dance Festival via her nonprofit platform, [Linsdans](https://www.linsderry.com/dance). Through Linsdans, she had the additional privilege of teaching internationally to over 300 enthusiastic participants and in higher education to a diversity of students as an Adjunct Lecturer. Current interests include human-computer interaction (specifically, embodied interaction), speculative design, choreographic interfaces, responsive environments, and the future of work. Presently, Lins is a Researcher at metaLAB (at) Harvard where she is contributing to the lab's Curatorial A(i)gents project.
