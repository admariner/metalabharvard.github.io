Sarah Newman is a Senior Researcher and Principal at metaLAB at Harvard, and a Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. As a researcher expressing ideas through installation art, her work engages with technology’s role in human experience. In addition to her art practice, she is also a facilitator and educator, and runs customized workshops that use creative materials to address complex, interdisciplinary research problems. Newman holds a BA in Philosophy from Washington University in St. Louis and an MFA in Imaging Arts from the Rochester Institute of Technology. She has exhibited work in New York, San Francisco, Miami, Berlin, London, and Rome, and has held artist residencies in Germany and Sweden. Newman is a 2017 AI Grant Fellow, a member of the 2018 Assembly Cohort, a co-founder of the Data Nutrition Project, and leads metaLAB’s ongoing initiative that explores the intersections of new technologies and human experience. Her current work explores the social and philosophical dimensions of artificial intelligence and uses interactive art as a means of critique and public engagement.
