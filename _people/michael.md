Michael Maizels is an art historian and curator whose research examines the crosscurrents of contemporary art, media and culture. He has published widely on the intersecting histories of art and music, including articles on Steve Reich and Richard Serra, John Luther Adams and Robert Smithson, Jay Z and Andy Warhol. His first book, on the process artist Barry Le Va, was published by the University of Minnesota Press in 2015.  His second book, on experimental art and music in the 1960s, is under review. He is at the beginning stages of a third book, which will examine the interplay between postwar art history and the shifting contemporary art market. Additionally, he curated The Game Worlds of Jason Rohrer, the first solo museum exhibition given to a videogame creator, which received favorable press in publications including The New York Times, The New Yorker, Artforum, Art in America and Vice. He is currently an assistant professor of art history at the University of Arkansas.
