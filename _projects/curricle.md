Commissioned by Harvardâ€™s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Curricle is a curriculum mapping experiment that serves as an advising tool as well as a deep institutional portrait of Harvard through its curricular history. 

A curricle was the sports car of the coaching era: a fast, light, and stylish two-wheeled chaise drawn by a judiciously matched pair of horses. With the spirit of its vehicular namesake, the project will develop a lively, interactive, playful mode of navigating curricular programming and choices not as catalogue but as the experience of a landscape of intersecting paths. Such an approach to college and university curricula aims to express a model that may also be followed by other institutions of higher learning.
