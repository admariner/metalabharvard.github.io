 In *[Idea Colliders](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/idea-colliders)* (the first volume in the new [metaLAB projects series](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/series/metalabprojects) with MIT Press), Michael John Gorman issues a provocative call for the transformation of science museums and science centers from institutions dedicated to the transmission of cultural capital to dynamic “idea colliders” that spark creative collaborations and connections. Drawing scientists into conversation with artists, designers, policymakers, and the public, the science museum becomes a participatory space for questions, experiences, and imagination.

 In conversation with metaLAB faculty director Jeffrey Schnapp, Gorman will discuss his trajectory in the museums world, point to provocations and innovative models around the world, and discuss key shifts he sees in the evolution of science museums, including from large to small, from interactive to participatory, from enclosed to porous, and from subject-specific to cross-disciplinary.
