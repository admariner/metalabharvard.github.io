**[Full position description](https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2019-05/job-opportunity-temporary-product-manager)**

**To begin immediately; this is a part-time, temporary position through December 2019.**

We're looking for a candidate with curiosity, institutional savvy, and acute organizational skills to act as part-time Product Manager for the release of [Curricle](../curricle), a course-selection platform designed within our metaLAB team.

Curricle brings the power of data visualization to student course discovery and registration, to reveal connections among courses and professors, discover exciting courses of study, and chart new pathways in learning. The Temporary Product Manager will have keen leadership and interpersonal skills, familiarity with technical projects and software development processes, management acumen, and a keen appreciation for the dynamism and complexity of the Harvard community. They will thrive in a creative, fun, and fast-paced atmosphere with a multidisciplinary core team of creative and dedicated researchers and designers, within a broader community of scholars, students, and artists across the disciplines. They are especially excited about projects that bring shared data into open, accessible platforms for public engagement, that open up colleges, archives, and cultural institutions to expressive collaboration, and that treat technology as a mode of inquiry.
