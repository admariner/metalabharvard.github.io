**MACHINE EXPERIENCE**

The possibilities of artificial intelligence have long seemed futuristic and far-fetched. Today, however, AI technology is making its impact felt in such real-world realms as autonomous vehicles, online searches and feeds, and the criminal justice system. 

In conjunction with the Berkman Klein Center and MIT Media Lab's recently announced Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative, metaLAB at Harvard will present MACHINE EXPERIENCE, a showcase of works by metaLAB artists exploring the emotional effects of algorithms, the uncanny experiences of sensor-enabled computers, and what intelligent machines might reveal about understandings of the nature of intelligence itself.

MACHINE EXPERIENCE will take place from August 8 to 13 in the [Harvard Art Museums'](http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/) Lightbox Gallery. Each day, the gallery will feature work by a different artist, encompassing sound, video, and interactive data visualization. There will be four gallery talks, and a launch event on Monday August 7th at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. For more information, visit the metaLAB website, or email [snewman@metalab.harvard.edu](mailto:snewman@metalab.harvard.edu). 

Harvard Art Museums is located at: 32 Quincy Street, Cambridge, MA; the Lightbox Gallery is on the 5th floor of the museum.
