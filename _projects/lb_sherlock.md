**Sherlock**
<br />Jonathan Sun
<br />Interactive chatbot
<br />2017

Thursday, August 10, 10am-5pm

Harvard Art Museums
<br />Lightbox Gallery

Chatbots are curious, sometimes helpful, and sometimes mystifying “creatures.” The subject of this installation is a chatbot named Sherlock, touted to be among the most advanced, intelligent AIs on the planet. So why would it want to talk to humans? This interactive installation will invite visitors to chat with Sherlock, a chatbot unlike one they’ve ever met.
