<em>Are secrets uniquely human?  Our private lives, relationships, experiences, and secrets are mediated, influenced, and recorded by digital devices. Where are our secrets now? Where will they be in the future, and who—or what—might read them? How will AI systems of the future process the data we leave behind? Will they know things about us that we don’t (and never could) know about ourselves? </em>

<em>Nobody’s Listening</em> provokes such questions as these, and many others. Multiple data feeds run simultaneously: a large paneled screen shows faces that have been extracted from an archive of photographs in the museum’s collection. These small, cropped, unidentified faces are being sorted and explored, by an unspecified logic, though seemingly correlating with the secrets. The photographs look old, and yet the secrets are contemporary, setting the piece in dialogue with time.  

At the secrets input station, visitors are invited to enter their own secrets; behind the input station, meanwhile, on the right channel in the projection, a printer issues secrets asynchronously. It is not clear how the printer’s logic is tied to the gallery secrets-input, either in frequency or content.  

Opposite the screens is a three-channel projection: on the left, running code is displayed, showing the secrets being translated into computerized voices; in the middle, there are more faces, shown larger, overlapping, showing noise, pixels, distortion. So seemingly human, these faces (like most of the faces we see in our daily lives) are digital representations of humans; they are data. The fleeting faces also suggest surveillance, facial recognition—the viewer can see and feel, how in the future, our faces might be cross-referenced with databases of information. 

From above, viewers hear what seem to be human secrets uttered by computerized voices—sometimes one at a time, sometimes with multiple voices overlapping. Many of us have grown accustomed to computer-generated voices—when they’re giving us driving directions or reporting the weather—but the experience of hearing them share vulnerable, personal secrets feels eerily dissonant. And yet we do trust machines with so much personal data; indeed, all of the secrets in this piece came from visitors who willingly typed in their secrets (either today, or during an earlier version of this installation created in collaboration with metaLAB creative technologist Jessica Yurkofsky in 2016).

One might imagine the installation puts us inside the “mind” of a machine-learning algorithm processing large data sets, producing results which may be accurate, and yet impossible for us to understand, perhaps in some ways similar to our own (biologically-based) intuition.  

<em>Nobody’s Listening</em> is a spatial and bodily experience—visitors are inside the system, and implicated in it.  The glossy screens reflect silhouettes of the people in the gallery; the secret you hear could belong to the person standing beside you, or to someone across the world. And yet whether they are true, and what sort of meaning we, or others, can derive from these systems (or these systems from us), remains an open and ongoing question.
